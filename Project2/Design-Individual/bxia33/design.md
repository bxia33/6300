## **Design Rational**
* TCCart is a payment and rewards management system for tea and coffee carts. The initial design is to assign all customers with a unique ID, which will have credits, VIP status, purchasing History. The rational behind this is to turn customer to member of this rewards program and the membership ID is the primary key to determine the customers' purchase history.
* Store the customer information in separate classes (Customer Class and ID Class) is to encourage customer to stay in the program and enjoy the rewards generated by the system. And allow customers to identify themselves by simply applying the QR code of the ID card to the system.
* Store all the rewards information with ID class, will also allow system to apply the rewards towards purchase by simply scanning the ID card.

## **Constraint of rewards system**
* Every time if purchase is bigger than $30 before any credit and coupon, system will issue a $3 credit to ID class for next time purchase only, and update the credit expiration date in the ID class.
* Remaining credit could be used for next time purchase.
* Discount should be applied before any credit.
* Customer will get VIP status associated with their ID if they purchase more than $300 in the anually year with associated ID card. VIP status will be available through the entire next calendar year.
